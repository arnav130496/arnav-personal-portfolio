## Important Files inside `app` folder

- `layout.tsx`: This is your "Shell." Anything you put here (like a Navbar or Footer) will appear on every page.

- `page.tsx`: This is the unique content for the current route. The one in the root app/ folder is your Homepage.

- `globals.css`: This is where Tailwind CSS is initialized. You can add custom global styles here, but try to stick to Tailwind utility classes in your components.
