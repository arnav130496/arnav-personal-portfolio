# This document is documenting my journey in setting up this app

## Day 1: Environment Setup

- setup a new `next.js` app using -> `npx create-next-app@latest`
- run the `npm run dev` to run the app on [local](http://localhost:3000)
- added new routes (blog, experience, projects)

## Day 2: Routing Setup

- Added routes and a Navbar
- Simply create sub folders within the `app` folder
- Added basic `page.tsx` files for each route
- Added routes using `Link` in the Navbar `.component`
